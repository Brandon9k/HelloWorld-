This is my first repo while using a Mac pc 

Hello my name is Brandon Christian i'm new to the ios development enviorment but i'm really looking forward to learning about ios app development 
and what I can build with its tools. Ideally i'm hoping to take everything i've learned and possible make an ios game 
with it down the line, I think that'll be a fun project to really challenge my knowledge and improve my skills as a developer.
